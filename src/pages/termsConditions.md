# Terms & Conditions

## Pay in instalments

These terms apply between Sevi Innovation Ltd. including its foreign subsidiaries and branches (“Sevi”, “we” or “us”) and the person or legal entity or institution ("you") who makes a purchase. If you choose the Sevi payment option (“Pay-in Instalments”) you agree to these terms (“Terms”). You can at any time access these terms via our website.

This is a payment option you can choose to part pay your purchases by dividing the cost into multiple payments.

How do I Pay in instalments?
----------------------------

Create a Sevi account by downloading the Sevi app and filling out your personal data for verification purposes. Once a personal account is created you can create a company account. Top-up your Sevi account from your mobile money or bank account.

By paying the first payment (“deposit”) either from your Sevi account or from M-Pesa implies you agree to these Terms. The remaining payments can be debited from your Sevi account on the due date of each instalment, or you can pay an instalment directly through the payment link. We will send you this payment link and tell you the due dates via electronic communication (e.g. SMS/push notification) and they are viewable in the Sevi application.

Deposit is defined as the sum of money that you as a Buyer pay at the start of the purchase. The deposit represents a portion of the total purchase price. In the Sevi app this deposit is defined as the "Pay now" amount.
Credit is defined as the sum of money that you as the Buyer pay at a later time then the purchase time, to finance the remainder of the purchase prize. In the Sevi app this is defined as the "Pay later" amount. This Pay later amount is lower or equal to the Credit Limit which is set at the sole discretion of Sevi.

You give us the authority to take the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi account on and after the due dates.
When you switch on the function to sweep any wallet top-up to any open credit, you give us the authority to take the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi account even before the due dates.

In the event the Seller or Sellers do not charge you for your entire order at the same time, we will create a different Pay-In-Instalments plan for each order part. This situation may be common where a Seller does not ship all the items from your order at the same time.

You will maintain an adequate credit balance on your Sevi account to allow for payments to be taken on the due dates, if you choose not to use the provided payment link. **It is important you ensure enough funds are available to complete your payment on the due date.**

What do I agree to?
-------------------

You must be over 18 years old.

You are authorised to make a purchase on credit on behalf of the entity you represent.

Your ID card needs to be valid and will be verified to prevent ID fraud.

Your phone number needs to be valid and will be verified by a one-time password (“OTP”) you receive per SMS.

It is at our discretion whether we offer you Pay-in-Instalments. We may limit the types of Top-up options we accept at our discretion.

We may carry out a limited credit search on you at a credit reference bureau. This search will not affect your credit score or your chances of obtaining a credit in future.

The number of instalments, fees and amount per instalment will be clearly communicated before entering into any payment option and can be reviewed in the Sevi app at any time. The period starts on confirmation by the Seller of delivery and ends on the due date of the final instalment (“Period”).

When you confirm to agree with these Terms, the first payment (“Deposit”) is taken from your Sevi account. If we, for any reason, are unable to charge the deposit from your Sevi account, the merchant will not hand over the product to you.

You authorize us to store your ID and phone number details on our systems. We will use this information to authorize future payments under these Terms. You may manage your profile and details through the Sevi app, data that has already been verified cannot be altered unless the new data is verified again by Sevi.

If you and the Seller cancel your purchase, we will cancel any remaining payments and pay back to your Sevi account any amounts we have taken and are paid to us by the Seller. Any part returns or refunds credited to your purchase and paid to us by the Seller will reduce your outstanding balance, but do not count as payments.

You will need to continue to make your previously disclosed payments at scheduled due dates until your balance is paid in full.

You are responsible for being able to receive SMS messages send by Sevi through our SMS service provider Africa’s Talking or any replacement service provider that will be communicated to our customers. Missed messages can never be an excuse for paying late.

Right to repay early
--------------------

You are entitled, to pay any instalment earlier then the due date. In the Sevi app you go to you Instalment overview and per instalment you can click “Pay”. Clicking this button pays that specific instalment, provided the balance in your Sevi account is enough, if not you are asked to first top-up your Sevi account.

Consequences of default and missed payments
-------------------------------------------

If we are not able to take an instalment from your Sevi account on the due date we might provide you a courtesy slack period of 24 hours, so that you can top-up your Sevi account. After 24 hours, **you will be charged a late fee of 1% per day**, up to a cumulative 6% by day 6. Paying late might also influence future decisions regarding future payment products that will be made available to you. 

You will be notified in good time via electronic communication to your verified phone number, about the payment failure so you’ll have enough time to make sure that you have sufficient funds in your Sevi account. 

If you fail to make a payment and have a Late status, you may be unable to use the service in the future. We continue to attempt to collect overdue and currently due payments on subsequent due dates, or invoice you separately for the unpaid total. You can pay any defaulted instalment at any time during the Period.

If you fail to pay any or all instalments for over 21 days, your account will get a Default status and a default fee of 10% is added to the total credit amount. When you are in default Sevi will engage internal debt collector, external debt collection agency or auctioneers to collect the outstanding amount. The cost for collection will be charged to you.

Title to the purchase using the Pay-in-Instalment option shall pass to you only upon payment in full of all instalments, including any additional fees and interest charged by us.

If you fail to pay, the Seller, Sevi debt collector, debt collection agency and our auctioneer are able to retrieve the purchase you made Therefore, use the purchase properly and do not modify or alter them. You shall not remove or alter identification or registration numbers on the purchase. You are responsible for loss of, or damage to the purchase. In such case you need to notify us. You are responsible for insurance of the purchase, insurance is applicable to items purchased above a certain amount and this option will be presented as a checkbox prior to agreeing to these Terms.

Please note that Sevi will notify you prior to; any withdrawals being made from your Sevi account; if a payment fails; if an instalment amount is in default; and if the debt is handed over to an external debt collection agency and auctioneer.

Missing payments can have serious consequences for you. Your Sevi score will be affected which will make it more difficult or more expensive for you to obtain credit in the future. Legal action may be taken against you to recover the debt, an application may be made to have you declared bankrupt, and it is possible that a charging order and order for sale of your property may be obtained as a means of enforcing any judgment.
