# Terms & Conditions


## Pay in instalments


These terms apply between Sevi B.V., including its foreign subsidiaries (“Sevi”, “we” or “us”) and you who makes a purchase. If you choose this payment option (“Payment in instalments”) you agree to these terms (“Terms”). You can at any time access these terms via our website.

This is a payment option you can choose to part pay your purchases by dividing the cost into multiple payments.

How do I Pay in instalments?
----------------------------

Create a Sevi account by downloading the Sevi app and filling out your personal data for verification purposes. Top-up your Sevi account from your M-Pesa. The first payment (“deposit”) is taken from your Sevi account at the time the merchant and you confirm delivery. The remaining payments will also be taken from your Sevi account every 7 days after the first payment is taken. We will tell you the due dates via electronic communication and they are viewable in the Sevi application.

You give us the authority to take the remaining instalment payments from your Sevi account on the due dates. In the event the merchant or merchants do not charge for your entire order at the same time, we will create a different Pay in instalments plan for each merchant charge. Each of these order parts will have its own due date depending on when the merchant and you confirm delivery of that part of your order. This situation may be common where a merchant or merchants do not ship all the items from your order at the same time.

You will maintain an adequate credit balance on your Sevi account to allow for payments to be taken on the due dates. **It is important you ensure enough funds are available to complete your payment on the due date. If you fail to make a payment you will be in default, and may be unable to use the service in the future. We continue to attempt to collect overdue and currently due payments on subsequent due dates, or invoice you separately for the unpaid total, or the merchant may use its debt collection procedures. If you do not pay for your purchase, Sevi may engage with an external debt collection agency to collect on the merchant behalf.**  

What do I need to know?
-----------------------

You must be 18 years old.

Your ID card needs to be valid and will be verified to prevent ID fraud.

Your phone number needs to be valid and will be verified by a one-time password (“OTP”) you receive per SMS.

It is at our discretion whether we offer you Payment in instalments. We may limit the types of Top-up options we accept at our discretion.

We may carry out a limited credit search on you at a credit reference bureau. This search will not affect your credit score or your chances of obtaining a credit in future.

The number of instalments and amount per instalment will be clearly communicated before entering into this payment option and can be reviewed in the Sevi app at all times. The period starts on confirmation by the merchant and you of delivery and ends on the due date of the final instalment (“Period”).

Before expected delivery date we will notify you to top-up your Sevi account with the deposit amount. When the merchant and you confirm delivery, the first payment (“deposit”) is taken from your Sevi account. If we, for any reason, would be unable to charge the deposit from your Sevi account, the merchant will not hand over the product to you.

If we are not able to take the following instalments from your Sevi account on the due date we will provide you a courtesy slack period of a few days so that you can top-up your Sevi account. You will be notified in good time via electronic communication to your verified phone number, about the payment failure and when the retries will be scheduled so you’ll have enough time to make sure that you have sufficient funds in your Sevi account. If we are not able to take the instalment during this period we will conduct a maximum of two (2) retries in order to try to collect the funds. If we were unable to withdraw funds after the two (2) retries, the missed instalment will get a defaulted status (“default”).

You can pay any defaulted instalment at any time during the Period and we will not charge you for doing so.

If any outstanding instalment is not paid before or on due date of the final instalment, we may invoice you the remaining amount or follow our debt collection procedures. **Please note that Sevi will notify you prior to any withdrawals are taken from your Sevi account, if a payment fails, if an instalment amount is in default and if the debt is handed over to an external debt collection agency**.

You authorize us to store your ID and phone number details on our systems. We will use this information to authorize future payments under these Terms. You may manage your profile and details through the Sevi app, verified data can not be altered unless the new data is verified by Sevi.

If you cancel your purchase we will cancel any remaining payments and pay back to your Sevi account any amounts we have taken. Any part returns or refunds credited to your purchase will reduce your outstanding balance, but do not count as payments. You will need to continue to make your previously disclosed payments at scheduled due dates until your balance is paid in full.

Consequences of default and missed payments
-------------------------------------------

If at any time, one or more instalments are overdue, we may serve a default notice on you, requiring that you bring the instalment payments up to date. If you then fail to do so, we may, by giving you written notice, terminate your Sevi account and/or require that you make immediate repayment of the outstanding balance of credit, interest and any fees on the Sevi account.

After termination, we or the merchant may employ a debt collection agency to recover the outstanding debt and you will have to pay reasonable costs incurred by the debt collection agency for this purpose.

Missing payments can have serious consequences for you. Your credit rating and Trust Score may be affected which will make it more difficult or more expensive for you to obtain credit in the future.  Legal action may be taken against you to recover the debt, an application may be made to have you declared bankrupt, and it is possible that a charging order and order for sale of your property may be obtained as a means of enforcing any judgment.
