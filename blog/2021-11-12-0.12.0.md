Today we launched version 0.12 of the mobile app. We have super interesting updates.

- From today it's possible to see the first Badges in your wallet card. This help you to understand the action that can be taking that helps you get the most out of the Sevi Service.
- The first infrastructure changes are made to allow wallet to buy product at a supplier. No need to ask the supplier to register with Sevi. All can managed just from your wallet.
