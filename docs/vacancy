# Back-end developer

## Introduction
Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of stable economies, in terms of job creation and GDP. However, in many low-income countries these SMEs are missing. Access to affordable finance is one of the main hurdles for micro entrepreneurs and farmers to grow their business. 

Sevi provides value chain financing in Kenya. Through our smartphone app sellers (e.g. producer, wholesaler) can sell their products on credit to their customers (e.g. small kiosk, vendors). The Sevi fund provides 80% upfront financing to the seller and the buyer pays through instalments. https://www.sevi.io
