# API

Currently Sevi provides an Graphql API. Any action done on the Admin portal or Mobile can be initiated by a mutation or query. 

As we are in active development, we have only internal API documentation. Please write us an email to retrieve this.

[Find here the production graphql API playground](https://exodus.sevi.io/graphql)
