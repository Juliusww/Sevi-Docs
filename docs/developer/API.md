# API

Currently Sevi provides an Graphql API. Any action done on the Admin portal or Mobile can be initiated by a mutation or query as well. 

As we are in active development, we have only internal API documentation. Please write us an email to retrieve this. We also have a postman examples so you can try them out.

[Find here the production graphql API playground](https://exodus.sevi.io/graphql)

To run queries or mutation set an header with 

{ Authorization: "token", account: "account"}

[get your API token](/docs/developer/API)
