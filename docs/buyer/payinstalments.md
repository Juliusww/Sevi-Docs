# Step 4: Pay instalments

We will remind you to pay your instalments on time. We remind you both through text SMS as well as push notifications in the App.

## Auto collection
Instalments are automatically deducted from your Sevi account on the due date of the instalment. Therefore always make sure you have sufficient balance in your Sevi account.

## Instalment overview
On your Sevi App tap on `Instalments` to see an overview of your instalments. This section will give you an overview of the status of your instalments per order. It shows how much you have already paid, and how much you still need to pay.
