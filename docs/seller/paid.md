# Getting paid

As a seller, you will encounter two payment scenarios: either the buyer can pay when placing the order, or they cannot. Below is a guide to help you navigate both scenarios.

### Buyer has no limit

When creating an order for a buyer who does not have an available “Sevi Pay Later” limit, the payment amount will not be reserved. In this case, while you can still proceed with the order, we cannot guarantee that the buyer will be able to pay upon delivery. The Admin Portal will notify you of this situation with a message like the one shown below:

### **Buyer with limit**

If the buyer has an available limit, the payment amount will be reserved for you until the order is marked as delivered or moved to the “Archived” status. The order can be archived by the seller, an agent, or the buyer, or it will automatically be archived. In the Admin Portal, buyers with a reserved payment limit will appear like this:

### **Delivery**

For a smooth delivery, it is essential that the buyer marks the order as “Delivered” using the USSD menu or the Sevi app. Once the order is confirmed as delivered, you, as the seller, will receive a delivery code. This code acts as proof of payment and can be shared with the delivery driver or agent. Additionally, you can verify that the order has been paid either through the Admin Portal or by consulting the agent.

### **Receiving** payment and Credit start

Once the order is delivered, the buyer’s credit will commence, and you, the seller, will instantly receive the payment.
