# Getting paid

When creating an order for a buyer, if the buyer has no available credit limit, the amount will not be reserved. In this case, as a seller, you cannot be completely certain that you will receive payment upon delivery.

However, if the buyer does have an available limit, that amount will be reserved until the order is marked as delivered or moved to the archived status. The order can be archived by the seller, an agent, or the buyer.

To ensure smooth delivery, itâ€™s important that the buyer marks the order as delivered through either the USSD menu or the Sevi app. Once the order is marked as delivered, a delivery code will be generated. This code serves as proof of payment and can be shared with the driver or agent. Additionally, the agent can verify in the app that the order has been successfully paid.
