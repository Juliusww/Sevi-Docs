# Credit limits

Based on the track record of both the Seller and the Buyer the specific credit limits are defined by the Sevi system.

When you reach on of these limits you will not be able to provide products on credit. Only the 'direct pay' option shows when selecting a payment option. 

You will receive one of the following error messages when you or your buyer reaches a credit limit.

    Seller reached max of outstanding instalments
This means you have reached your max 'Order now, Pay later' limit. This is the sum of all open instalments of all your buyers combined. Once your buyers pay instalments, this will free up space and allow you to provide 'Order now, Pay later' again. By a positive track record on Sevi this limit will increase overtime.

    Order amount exceeds allowed seller limit
The order amount is to high. With your current track record on Sevi you are only able to sell smaller orders on credit. By a positive track record this order amount limit will increase overtime.

    Buyer should first pay the open instalments
Your buyer has open installments which are not paid before the due date. Please remind your buyer to first pay these overdue instalments, to be able to use 'Order now, Pay later'. This can also be overdue instalments on orders at another Seller. More information on [how to pay instalments](/docs/buyer/payinstalments). 

    Order amount exceeds allowed buyer personal limit
Your buyer is making an order from his/her personal Sevi account or as a Sole Proprietorship. The buyer is not able to pay for this order in instalments, because the sum of all his/her orders combined is too high. These orders can also be at another Seller on Sevi. Ask your buyer to pay instalments of other orders first, to be able to 'Order now, Pay later'. Or ask your buyer to order from a Limited Company. 

    Order amount exceeds allowed buyer company limit
Your buyer is making an order from a Limited Company. This company is not able to pay for this order in instalments, because the sum of all the companies orders combined is too high. These orders can also be at another Sellers on Sevi. Ask your buyer to pay instalments of other orders first, to be able to 'Order now, Pay later'. 

    Seller exceeds more than 10% late installments
The sum of all instalments that are overdue of all your buyers combined is more than 10% of the sum of all open instalments of all your buyers combined. Please remind your buyer to first pay these overdue instalments, to be able to 'Order now, Pay later'. More information on [how to pay instalments](/docs/buyer/payinstalments).
