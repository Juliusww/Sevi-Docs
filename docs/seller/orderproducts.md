# Step 2: Create order

As a agent you can create an order for your customer. 

## Go to customer section
Go to your `Company account`, then click `Customers` to go the customer section. Here you find an overview of all registered customers. If your customer is not yet registered please go to [step 1](/docs/seller/register) first.

Click on the customers name, for whom you want to create an order.

Click ‘CREATE ORDER’

Enter a `Description`, `Price` and `Quantity` to add the new product to the order.

You can add extra items by clicking `+`

To finalize the process click `CREATE ORDER`
