# Step 4: Delivery

The customer has accepted the payment plan and paid the deposit amount. You are now ready to deliver the order. 

## In-app orders
When you created an order in the app on behalf of your customer and you successfully filled-out the OTP, you can immediately deliver the product. The status of the order is automatically and instantly changed into *'Delivered'* and the payment plan is activated. In the `Customers` section you find the status of the order, which should be *'Delivered order'*, when clicking the relevant customers name.

## Webshop orders
When you or your customer created the order through your companies webshop, you need to manual set the status of the order from *'Purchased order'* to *'Delivered order'* once you delivered the order.

Go to the `Customers` section and click the relevant customer. Click `Set as Delivered` to change the status. 
    > Changing the status to delivered is crucial, since the new 
    status triggers:
    - Payment plan to start running
    - Advance payment to your companies wallet

#### Only deliver when status is *'Purchased order'*
When the order status is *'Pending order'*, you should NOT deliver the order, as the deposit has not been paid yet.

Only deliver the order when the status is *'Purchased order'*, this means the order and payment plan have been accepted by the customer and the deposit has been paid.
