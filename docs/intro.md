# About Sevi 

## Introduction
Reach a bigger target market and sell more products by providing a ‘Pay in Installment’ option to your
customers. Selling on credit without the hassle or the risk.
Sevi offers a simple-to-use smartphone app for your sales agents and your customers. The Sevi app
provides them with:
- Overview of their orders
- Overview of credit and installments
- Reminders and to do list

Sevi also offers a credit fund to pre-finance the products sold on credit. The Sevi fund pays you 80%
on delivery and on the final payment the last 20%.

We provide a plugin (WooCommerce) to integrate the Sevi ‘Pay in Installments’ option in your
eCommerce website and a portal to manage your orders and credits. The portal also allows you to set
pre-defined loan conditions fitting your target market.
No webshop yet? No worries, Sevi provide an easy pre-set eCommerce template to upload the
products you want to sell.

## Vision
Providing affordable finance to entrepreneurs is a crucial condition for further growth of micro and
small companies, contributing to economic growth and a dignified life for entrepreneurs, their
employees and families. We believe merchant finance based on real orders and delivery is the best
way to loan to low-income clients because it limits default risks. We believe using new digital
technologies can unleash the full potential of this model.

## Mission
We empower entrepreneurs with access to ethical and affordable credit to grow their business.
